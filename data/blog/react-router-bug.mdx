summary: React-router got me agitated indefinitiely. Problem with history and react-router versioning.
---

I had tried to solve a severe bug (for several weeks FYI), which eventually comprehended to be a really stupid missing piece that delayed my moment of exaltation pretty much for 3 weeks to be precise.

Do you know what the best part is? It wasn't just me who was perplexed with this bug, but a few others that had spent a great amount of time in scrutiny.

The bug was with the `react-router` package. If you want to reproduce the bug and try it yourself or want to check out the community discussion you can visit the link below.

- [history.push not re-rendering component.](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/7415)

## What was the bug all about?

Well here's the gist. Let us imagine we have two components, `CreateProduct` and `AllProducts`. The CreateProduct component essentially creates a Product (through react form) and sends a POST request to the backend API for persistent storage. It then uses history props passed in tacitly by react-router to route to the AllProducts page. The AllProducts page lists out all the products that have been created.

But the problem was that when we redirected to the AllProducts page from CreateProduct, the most recent item that was created didn't show up until hard reload. I believe it was probably a case of local mutation. But to sum up:

- The bug was that `history.push` redirected me to the desired page but wasn't re-rendering the component with the new data.
- And, it required a subsequent hard refresh for the new data to be rendered on the page.

## Components

The AllProducts component had a `useEffect` hook that ran but couldn't find any new data and hence it wasn't re-rendering the component.

```javascript
const AllProducts = () => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
    setLoading(false);
  }, []);
```

Below I have attached a code snippet of the CreateProduct component. This is where we made a POST request to the backend API for storing the data, and as you can see we have a history.push method right in the .then promise chain.

```javascript
    axios
      .post(api, formData, {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
        },
      })
      .then(() => {
        history.push('/allproducts');
      })
  };

```

## Possible Solutions

If you have made us of the history npm package for session storage, a possible solution could be looking to install a particular version of history compatible with react-router as mentioned below.

```bash
$ npm list history
npm list v1.13.0

├─ history@5.0.0
├─ react-router-dom@5.2.0
│  └─ history@4.10.1
└─ react-router@5.2.0
   └─ history@4.10.1

$ npm i history@4.10.1
```

A few of them in the community suggested that using `history@4.10.1` with `react-router-dom@5.2.0` happens to solve the issue.

And a few other suggests that to prevent calling `history.push` on render we can wrap it around useEffect hook.

Unfortunately, none of them worked for me. I relentlessly tried every single fix that might budge the bug down but that certainly didn't happen.

## What worked for me? The Fix.

We have the same AllProducts component here. The [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) suggested that useEffect hook API accepts a second argument.

> You can tell React to skip applying an effect if certain values haven’t changed between re-renders. To do so, pass an array as an optional second argument to useEffect.

```javascript
const AllProducts = () => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
    setLoading(false);
  }, []);
```

We pass an empty array as a second argument for React to re-render only when the value changes or a new data is added. It turns out I didn't pass the products list inside the useEffect hook as a second parameter and React knew nothing about new data being drilled until the hard refresh.

And right after I passed the products inside the useEffect like so

```javascript
const AllProducts = () => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
    setLoading(false);
  }, [products]);
```

everything worked out as normal and the AllProducts component was now re-rendering and was updating the stale data with the new data.

Welp! That was probably a word that I missed and the world was falling apart. I very rightly know that it was a ingenuous missing piece on my part and it took me atleast a couple weeks to figure it out, but you know what, that's what coding teaches you. It taught me to be reselient and learn something the hard way.

Happy Coding!
