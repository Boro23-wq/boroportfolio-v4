Not a very long time ago, CSS style sheets were the only appropriate way to paint any modern app. That is basically the traditional method of styling at the document level — creating a `style.css` file and referencing it on the HTML document for the styles to appear.

But with constant updates and improvements, we now have with us something known as styled-components. Styled components are basically an innovative way of using Javascript’s ES6 syntax, along with CSS which enables us to enhance our styling in React components. From very old and basic `.css` files to `.scss` files and `styled-components`, there have been some massive upgrades so to speak.

To put out in very simple terms, styled-components allow us to write CSS inside of JavaScript. That’s it! We can still use CSS/SCSS files that would still be compiled back into CSS modules.

Before we run through what styled-components can bring to the table let me clarify why do we even need them.

Well, imagine when an application grows and expands there are certainly a lot more things to consider being a developer. Worrying about dedicating a specific folder to encapsulate all the CSS related files, identifying how to scope them, and making very sure that there are no clashes in namespaces. These are a few of the many problems that styled-components are effectively intercepting right off the bat. Additionally, encapsulating CSS in JavaScript also means no more extensive HTTP requests to fetch all the CSS assets beforehand.

## Why Styled Components (Extended)?

Styled components allow us to write CSS inside of JavaScript using tagged template literals (``) and it removes the overhead of mapping components and styles together.

Styled components were created to handle the following reasons:

- Styled components automatically monitor components that are rendered on a webpage and only injects the critically required styles. This means that there is no overhead of extra HTTP requests for fetching the CSS assets.

- Styled components generate unique class names for the styles. Developers now don’t have to worry about namespace clashes.

```css
<div className='texts View-sadj kssytz'>
  <Title className='asndj View-sdda asds'>
    <h2 className='title View-ttyus hhyat'>... ...</h2>
  </Title>
</div>
```

- Adapting the styling of a component based on its props or a global theme is simple and intuitive without having to manually manage dozens of classes.

- Automatic vendor prefixing: write your CSS to the current standard and let Styled components handle the rest. Styled components use the [stylis.js](https://stylis.js.org/) package under the hood for prefixing the CSS rules.

## Features of Styled-components

<b>1. Passing Props:</b>

Props in styled-components act the same way as props passed into any React component.

```css
const buttonStyles = css`
background-color: black
color: white;
`;

const invertedButtonStyles = css`
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
`;

const googleSignInStyles = css`
  background-color: #4285f4;
  color: white;
  border: none;
`;

const getButtonStyles = (props) => {
  if (props.isGoogleSignIn) {
    return googleSignInStyles;
  }

  return props.inverted ? invertedButtonStyles : buttonStyles;
};
```

<b>2. Dynamically Changing Elements:</b>

We can dynamically change elements using styled-components as demonstrated below. As you can see in the example below we convert a `span` element to act as `link` passing the 'as' prop made available to us.

```css
export const CustomText = styled.span`
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
`;

return <CustomText as='a'>CustomText is now changed to a link!</CustomText>;
```

Now, although `CustomText` is only a span, it will behave like a link.

<b>3. Leveraging Themes:</b>

Themes allow us to be consistent by making styles available to all our different components. We can now define a common style and apply it to any component we want.

```css
const theme = {
    color: {
        dark: '#000000'
        medium: '#cfcfcf'
        light: '#ffff'
    }
}

const CustomText = styled.h2`
   font-color: ${props => props.theme.color.dark}
`

render(
    <div>
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
            <CustomText>I am a dark text!</CustomText>
        </ThemeProvider>
    </div>
);
```

There are tons of handy features that styled-components come with. It also has a few advanced features like concurrent server-side-rendering and passing ref props, just to name a few.
